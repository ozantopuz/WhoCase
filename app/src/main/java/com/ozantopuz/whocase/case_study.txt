Imagine we are creating a simple, single screen app that lists people.

	- Every person that is listed has an `id` and a `fullName`
	- There are lots of people to list and only a small subset of them can be retrieved from our `DataSource` at once. So we need a "pagination" mechanism.
	- There should be a "Pull to Refresh" functionality for refreshing the list.
	- Proper error handling and a retry implementation is required.
	- When there is no one for listing, a proper message should be displayed. Also, in this case, we need to implement a functionality to refresh the list.
	- Listing should be unique by person `id`. Duplicate items are not allowed. (People who have same `fullName`s but different 'id's are allowed.)

1) You are provided pre-implemented classes like `DataSource`, `Person`, `FetchResponse` and `FetchError` (and some other helper structures). Use these classes from "DataSource.kt" in your project.
2) You can use RecyclerView in order to display data.
3) In order to fetch first set of people, use `DataSource`s `fetch` method by passing null into its `next` parameter and a completion handler.
4) "Completion Handler" has 2 parameters in its signature. A response or an error instance is passed when the operation finishes. They can't be both null or hold non-null references at a time.
5) When success, `FetchResponse` instance is passed into completion handler. This instance has people array and a `next` identifier which can be used for pagination.
6) Pass successful response's `next` identifier into `fetch` method in order to get next "pages".

Tips:
	- Retrying aggressively is bad for our "backend service"
	- No 3rd party dependency is required.
	- You can change `constants` in `DataSource` class for testing purposes.
	- No action is required for item selection.
	- Some screenshots are provided for you.
